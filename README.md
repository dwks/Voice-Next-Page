About
============================

The speech recognition powering this app is based on Silvius, an open source
client-server speech engine (and yes, it is possible to run your own speech
servers): http://voxhub.io/silvius

This app appeared in a poster at ASSETS 2018 and in a talk at CCC 2020 (rc3).

Developed by Sarah Leventhal, Serena Tam, and David Williams-King. For
questions or comments, please contact David at `dwk at voxhub period io`.
